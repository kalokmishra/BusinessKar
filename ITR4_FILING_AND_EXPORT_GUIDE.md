## 2. Formal ITR-4 Tax Summary Document (PDF Export)

The **ITR-4 Return Filing & e-File Export** tab (`ITR4MapperTab.tsx`) includes an export engine (`generateITR4SummaryPdf` in `src/utils/pdfExporter.ts`) that generates a formal, high-resolution computation statement formatted per CBDT Form ITR-4 standards.

## 3. Pre-Filing Validation Engine (`validateITR4SchemaCompliance`)

Before generating the official JSON payload or filing on the portal, the application runs automated pre-filing compliance checks:

1. **PAN Format Verification**:
   - Must strictly match the 10-character alphanumeric regex `^[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1}$`.
2. **RBI IFSC Bank Branch Validation**:
   - Must strictly match the 11-character RBI branch code regex `^[A-Z]{4}0[A-Z0-9]{6}$`.
3. **Primary Refund Account Configuration**:
   - At least one validated bank account must be flagged as `isPrimaryForRefund: true` to prevent rejection by the IT Department's Centralized Processing Center (CPC).
4. **Section 44ADA 50% Profit Floor Compliance**:
   - Verifies that declared presumptive income is at least 50% of gross professional receipts.
5. **Turnover & Cash Limit Verification**:
   - Evaluates whether turnover qualifies for the standard limits (₹2 Cr for 44AD / ₹50L for 44ADA) or requires cash receipts to remain `<= 5%` for extended limits (₹3 Cr / ₹75L).
