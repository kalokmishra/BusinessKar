# Businesskar: Freelancer & Presumptive Tax Engine

## 🌟 Executive Overview: Why Businesskar?

Filing income tax as an Indian freelancer, independent consultant, software professional, or small business owner is often confusing, time-consuming, and risky. Managing complex tax regulations like **Section 44ADA**, **Section 44AD**, quarterly **Advance Tax penalties under Section 234C**, **Capital Gains taxes (STCG & LTCG)**, and **Cash Deposit limits** can lead to overpaying taxes or facing scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.

**Businesskar** is a complete, rules-as-code Tax Computation and Compliance Portal engineered specifically for modern Indian professionals. Whether you earn through domestic freelance contracts, salary plus freelance work, international client exports, or stock market investments, **Businesskar** calculates your exact tax liability, optimizes your tax regime selection, monitors banking surveillance risks, and exports official **ITR-4 (Sugam) JSON payloads** for 1-click filing.
